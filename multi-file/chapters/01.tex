\chapter{Introduction}

    Recently, there has been significant progress in terms of Artificial Intelligence (later called AI) and Machine Learning (later called ML). Projects that in the past could barely recognize some simple objects or try to recognize some patterns are now surpassed by programs like advanced chat bots that can talk about literally anything or AIâ€™s that can create very realistic art. Many famous personas like Elon Musk or Bill Gates start to recognize the potential of AI. 
    As this field is rapidly growing it appears to be both reasonable and demanded to perform research in this area.
