\chapter{Introduction}

    Recently, there has been significant progress in terms of Artificial Intelligence (later called AI) and Machine Learning (later called ML). Projects that in the past could barely recognize some simple objects or try to recognize some patterns are now surpassed by programs like advanced chat bots that can talk about literally anything or AIâ€™s that can create very realistic art. Many famous personas like Elon Musk or Bill Gates start to recognize the potential of AI. 
    As this field is rapidly growing it appears to be both reasonable and demanded to perform research in this area.

    This work aims to create a target application to learn about the possibilities of neural networks in the context of predicting the stock exchange prices. The presented project is educational and designed to enable experimentation with the use of parameters of a given neural network - such as input data size, range, epoxy quantity, et cetera. In order to allow the end user to interact with the presented application easily, the project requires creating a simple graphical interface, so the end user can easily interact with the application and quickly view the results. Experimentation and the student's interaction with the assigned field is the best way to learn. For this purpose, this work focused on simple but logical dependencies on this particular type of neural network. The aim of this project was not to present an application capable of predicting the actual stock market but rather to create an application that could improve learning and showcase the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. The goal was not only to educate but also to inspire to act and improve the current knowledge.
