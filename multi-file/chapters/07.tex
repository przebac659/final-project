\chapter{Conclusions}

In times of rapid development of new technologies, it is crucial to support those who want to learn and may even develop new technologies themselves in the future. For this reason, all educational platforms and learning projects are essential for the excellent development of society.
In this project, a space to work with artificial intelligence has been created. The created platform allows users to compare charts of different companies whose stock prices have been predicted by a simple neural network. More inquisitive users will also be able to test different versions of the network by changing the parameters or simply choose one of the previously trained models. Thanks to this, the end user will be able to see the relationship between, for example, the size of the data set and the final results on real examples.
The presented project is open-source, and further development of the project is not only welcome but also expected. In the beginning, adding more options to the graphical interface will be worth it. Thanks to this, not only a user more familiar with programming will be able to use the project fully, but also an average enthusiast of artificial intelligence.
